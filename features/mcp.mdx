title: "MCP (Model Context Protocol)"
description: "Connect any data source to Emergent using MCP - a universal protocol that lets AI agents integrate with any API, database, or system through simple configuration."
---

Emergent has always made API integration straightforward.\
We’ve built reliable **integration playbooks** for common APIs — when you say _“Integrate Stripe payments”_ or _“Add Google authentication,”_ our agents know exactly what to do.

Now, with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** support, you can connect **any data source**, even those Emergent hasn’t seen before.

---

## What Is an MCP Server?

An **MCP server** acts as a smart adapter that lets Emergent’s AI agents communicate directly with any external service, tool, or database.

Instead of writing code or managing complex API credentials, MCP servers **translate your data source into a format Emergent can understand** - instantly.

| Analogy           | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Playbooks** | Predefined recipes for popular integrations — fast, reliable, but limited to known services. |
| **MCP Servers**   | Flexible translators that work with _any_ system, even custom or proprietary ones.           |

<Info>
  With MCP, you’re no longer limited to pre-built integrations.\
  If a service has an MCP server, Emergent can connect to it immediately — no middleware, no coding.

## Why MCP Matters

Emergent’s existing playbooks already support popular integrations like:

- **Payments:** Stripe, PayPal
- **Authentication:** Google, GitHub
- **Databases:** Supabase, Airtable

With **MCP support**, you can now connect to:

- Proprietary or internal systems unique to your organization
- Specialized or industry-specific tools
- Custom databases or data warehouses
- Legacy systems with unique protocols
- New tools as soon as they release MCP servers

<Tip>
  MCP brings unlimited integration flexibility — you can connect any data source, structured or not.

## Connecting an MCP Server

MCP configuration is **project-specific**, giving you full control over which data sources each app can access.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Advanced Controls">
    Before starting your project, click **Advanced Controls** in the project setup screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open MCP Tools">
    Inside Advanced Controls, click **Select MCP Tools** to open your MCP configuration panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Configuration Method">
    - **Option A: Configure a New MCP Server**
      1. Click **Configure New MCP**
      2. Name your server (e.g., `company-database`, `weather-api`)
      3. Add an optional description
      4. Paste your JSON configuration
      5. Click **Verify and Save**
    - **Option B: Enable Existing MCPs** Toggle on previously configured MCP servers to reuse them without re-entering credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Building">
    Once configured, start your project.\
    Emergent’s agents will have access to these connected data sources throughout the build process.
  </Step>
</Steps>
