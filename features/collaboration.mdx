## Personal vs. Team Workspaces

Your personal workspace and team workspace are completely separate environments:

| Element        | Personal Workspace             | Team Workspace                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Projects       | Only you can see and access    | All team members can view and collaborate |
| Credits        | Your individual credit balance | Shared pool of 1,250 credits/month        |
| Custom Agents  | Private to your account        | Accessible to all team members            |
| Universal Keys | Your personal API integrations | Shared API integrations for the team      |

<Tip>
  Switch between workspaces instantly using the switcher at the top of your chat interface.

Toggle instantly between your personal and team workspaces:
