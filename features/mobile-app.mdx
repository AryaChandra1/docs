## Deployment Options

Emergent uses **Expo** for mobile app deployment. You can deploy for testing or publish to app stores.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Option 1: Expo Development Build (Testing)">
    - Use **Deploy → Mobile App Deployment** in Emergent.
    - The Mobile Agent creates a sharable build link or QR code.
    - Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app to test instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Option 2: Production Deployment (App Stores)">
    - Build for **Apple App Store** or **Google Play Store** using Expo EAS.
    - Follow store submission guidelines.
    - Upload `.ipa` or `.aab` files for review and release.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Option 3: Direct APK Distribution">
    - Generate an **APK file** for Android.
    - Distribute directly without Play Store (useful for enterprise/internal apps).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Each deployed mobile app consumes **50 credits/month** for managed hosting and updates.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expo Build Errors**          | Share the full error message with the Mobile Agent: “Please fix this Expo build error: [error]” |
| **App Not Loading in Expo Go** | Ensure both your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network. Restart the Expo server.     |
| **API Connection Issues**      | Verify backend URL and CORS settings in your FastAPI server.                                    |
| **Component Not Rendering**    | Check React Native imports and platform-specific code. Test on both iOS and Android.            |

<Note>
  The Mobile Agent can debug issues automatically — just describe what’s happening and share any error messages.
