## The Problem It Solves

Previously, users building AI-integrated apps with Emergent had to:

- Create separate accounts on **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Google**
- Manage multiple API keys for **GPT**, **Claude**, and **Gemini**
- Track different usage limits and billing systems
- Regenerate or replace credentials across apps

<Info>
  Universal Key eliminates all of this.\
  Use one secure key managed by Emergent to access every supported model.

## How to Access and Use the Universal Key

You can access and manage your Universal Key in two ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Method 1: Use the Agent (Recommended)">
    The easiest way to use Universal Key is to simply **ask your Emergent agent**.\
    Example prompt:

    > “Use my Universal API Key for this project.”\
    > The agent automatically integrates and configures everything for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Method 2: Manual Access">
    If you prefer to manage it manually:

    1. Click your **account icon** in Emergent
    2. Go to **Account Settings**
    3. Select **Universal Key** in the sidebar
    4. View, disable, or regenerate credentials
    5. Open **LLM Providers** to toggle which models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) are active

## Credit Management and Billing

All usage through the Universal Key draws from your **Emergent Credits** balance.

- **Top-Up Anytime**: Add more credits via your account dashboard
- **Auto-Recharge**: Set automatic reload thresholds (e.g., recharge 500 credits when balance hits 0)
- **Unified Tracking**: View and manage model usage across GPT, Claude, and Gemini in one place

<Tip>
  No separate invoices or billing from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google — everything is handled inside Emergent.
</Tip>

---

## Example Use Case

**Goal:** Build a chatbot that can see, talk, and create.

- Use **Claude** for advanced reasoning and responses
- Use **GPT-Image-1** for generating visuals
- Use **Gemini** for analyzing uploaded images

All three run under a single Universal Key configuration — no extra setup or API juggling required.

<Check>
  One credential. Multiple models. Fully managed by Emergent.
</Check>

## Summary

Universal Key lets you access multiple AI models — GPT, Claude, Gemini, and others — using a single, secure credential.\
It simplifies setup, unifies billing, and removes the complexity of managing multiple APIs or keys.

<Info>
  Build faster with one key that powers every model on Emergent.
