## Use Case 4: Managing Multiple Project Versions

<Info>
  If you’re experimenting with different features or want to maintain multiple versions of your app, use branches to manage them effectively.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Experimental Branch">
    - Open your main project in Emergent.
    - Save to GitHub with a new branch name (e.g. `experimental-ui`).
    - Build and test your experimental features separately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch Between Versions">
    - **Main version** → Pull from `main` branch.
    - **Experimental version** → Pull from `experimental-ui` branch.
    - Each branch represents a distinct version of your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge Successful Experiments">
    - Use GitHub’s pull request system to merge successful experiments into the main branch.
    - Delete unneeded branches once merged.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Keep experimental branches isolated until features are stable and reviewed.
</Tip>
