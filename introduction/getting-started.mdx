### How to Start Vibecoding as a Complete Beginner

Welcome to the world of **Vibecoding** — a new way to build applications using natural language instead of traditional code.

Instead of learning frameworks, syntax, or programming languages, you simply talk to an AI agent about what you want to build — and Emergent turns that vision into a working app.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to:

- Go from a business idea to a live app without writing code
- Communicate effectively with AI agents
- Build, test, and iterate naturally
- Handle errors and refine your application
- Add features like payments, user accounts, and more

## What Is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding flips traditional programming on its head.

Instead of learning how to code, you focus on **what** you want to build — and Emergent’s AI agents handle the **how**.

| Traditional Coding                  | Vibecoding                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Learn syntax, frameworks, and tools | Describe your idea in plain English |
| Spend hours debugging               | Watch the AI build in minutes       |
| You write every line                | You direct the outcome              |

Example:

You: “Add a user authentication system with email and password.”\
Emergent: Builds it in 5 minutes — ready to test and iterate.

<Tip>
  The better you describe what you want, the better the result.\
  Vibecoding is 80% communication, 20% refinement.
</Tip>

---

## The Vibecoding Mindset

Vibecoding isn’t about syntax — it’s about **vision and clarity**.

You focus on:

- The problem you’re solving
- Who your users are
- What the experience should feel like

Emergent focuses on:

- Clean code structure
- Framework selection
- Debugging, optimization, and deployment

<Info>
  You’re no longer a coder — you’re a product designer and creative director.\
  Emergent handles the engineering.
</Info>

## Understanding Emergent

Emergent is your **vibecoding platform** — an AI-powered development environment where you build full-stack apps through conversation.

You don’t need a code editor, terminal, or hosting setup.\
Just describe your idea, and Emergent builds, tests, and deploys it for you.

---

### Example

This Spider-Man landing page was built entirely using AI — from prompt to production.

## How Emergent Works

With Emergent, you describe what you want → Emergent writes the code → your app goes live.\
It’s a true conversation-to-deployment flow.

Emergent handles:

- AI agents (E1, E1.1, E1.5, Mobile, Prototype)
- React frontends + Node.js backends + MongoDB databases
- Automatic testing and GitHub version control
- One-click deployment with custom domains
- Integrations like Stripe, OAuth, and external APIs

<Check>
  You focus on ideas. Emergent handles infrastructure.

## Choosing the Right Agent

| Agent         | Best For                 | Speed    | Quality   | Use When                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **E-1**       | Complex, production apps | Slower   | Highest   | Building real products for customers |
| **E-1.1**     | Balanced builds          | Moderate | High      | Everyday projects                    |
| **E-1.5**     | Careful, detailed builds | Moderate | Very High | Mission-critical apps                |
| **Prototype** | Quick UI mockups         | Fastest  | Basic     | Design validation                    |
| **Mobile**    | iOS + Android apps       | Moderate | High      | Mobile-first builds                  |

## The Universal LLM Key

You don’t need to manage multiple AI API keys.\
Emergent provides a **Universal LLM Key** that gives you access to GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and more — through one billing system powered by **Emergent Credits**.

<Info>
  No API setup. No billing headaches. Just start building instantly.
</Info>

## Your First Vibecoding Project

Let’s build your first app: a **Personal Book Tracker**.\
It’s simple, useful, and a perfect way to learn the flow.

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Business Goal">
    Spend 5 minutes thinking about your idea.\
    Ask yourself:

    - What problem am I solving?
    - Who is this for?
    - What are the 3–5 essential features?

    Example:

    - Problem: Forget which books I’ve read
    - Core Features: Add books, track progress, rate books, view stats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Initial Prompt">
    Use this prompt framework:

    ```
    Create an app for [PURPOSE] that includes:
    - [FEATURE 1]
    - [FEATURE 2]
    - [FEATURE 3]
    - [DESIGN STYLE]
    ```

    Example Prompt:\
    Create a personal book tracking app where users can:

    - Add books with title, author, and cover image
    - Mark books as “Want to Read”, “Currently Reading”, or “Finished”
    - Rate and review books
    - View reading statistics
    - Search by title or author

    Use warm, library-themed colors and a clean grid layout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Planning Session">
    The agent will ask clarifying questions like:

    - “Use Universal LLM Key?” → Yes
    - “Add authentication?” → Not yet
    - “Design preferences?” → Tailwind CSS with warm tones

    <Tip>
      Unsure about a term? Ask the agent to explain before building.\
      Every build is a learning opportunity.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch It Build">
    Once confirmed, Emergent begins generating your app:

    - Project structure created
    - Database setup (MongoDB)
    - UI components rendered
    - Features implemented
    - Testing complete

    <Info>
      Builds usually take 5–15 minutes.\
      Read the agent’s explanations — they teach you how the app works.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your First Version">
    Once it’s live, open the preview link and test every feature.\
    Check your browser console (F12) for any errors or issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate and Improve">
    After testing, note what you’d like to refine.

    Good Feedback Example:

    - Make book covers 20% larger
    - Add a delete button
    - Show a “Currently Reading” section at the top

    Bad Feedback Example:

    - “Make it better”

    <Check>
      Be clear and specific. The agent rewards detail and direction.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handling Your First Error">
    Don’t panic — errors are part of the process.\
    Example:

    ```
    Error: Failed to POST /api/books
    Status: 500 Internal Server Error
    ```

    How to report it: “When I click ‘Add Book’, nothing happens.\
    Console shows: Error 500 – Failed to POST /api/books.”

    <Note>
      Always describe what you expected vs. what happened,\
      and report one issue at a time.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Wrapping Up

You don’t need to learn to code — you need to learn to communicate with AI.\
That’s the essence of vibecoding.

You describe what you want, the agent builds it, and you refine through feedback.

<Info>
  Start small (like the Book Tracker), focus on clarity, and iterate one step at a time.
</Info>

---

## Your Next Steps

1. Pick a simple idea you actually want to use
2. Write one clear prompt with 3–5 features and a vibe note
3. Let Emergent build it
4. Test, refine, and repeat

As you grow comfortable, add **auth, payments, and integrations** when they serve your product — not before.

<Tip>
  Vibecoding is more like directing than programming.\
  You set the vision; Emergent handles the execution.
</Tip>

  Your first working app is closer than you think —\
  open Emergent, drop your first prompt, and watch your idea come alive.
