## What Are Credits?

Credits are the core unit of work on Emergent — everything runs on them.

Each plan comes with a **monthly credit allowance** used for:

- Natural language app generation
- Code generation and modifications
- Frontend & backend development
- Testing and debugging
- Cloud deployments (50 credits/month per app)
- Integrations and troubleshooting

<Tip>
  Everything - from chat prompts to full app generation - consumes credits.\
  If your balance hits zero, development pauses until renewal or a top-up.
</Tip>

## Credit Accounting & Calculations

### Monthly Credit Behavior

- **Subscription Credits:** Allocated monthly, reset each billing cycle.
- **Top-up Credits:** \$10 for 50 credits, never expire.
- **Usage Order:** Subscription → Top-up.

<Note>
  Monthly subscription credits do **not** roll over.
</Note>

---

### Prorated Upgrade Logic

If you upgrade from **Standard (200/month)** mid-cycle, your billing and credits are automatically adjusted so you only pay for the remaining days in your current billing cycle.

**Example Scenario:**

| Detail             | Value                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Current Plan**   | Standard (\$20/month) |
| **New Plan**       | Pro (\$200/month)     |
| **Billing Cycle**  | 30 days               |
| **Day of Upgrade** | Day 15                |
| **Unused Days**    | 15                    |

---

#### Billing Calculation

| Formula                  | Example         | Result                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Credit from current plan | \$20 ÷ 30 × 15  | **\$10**                 |
| Cost of new plan         | \$200 ÷ 30 × 15 | **\$100**                |
| **Final charge**         | $100 − $10      | **\$90 due immediately** |

<Info>
  You’ll be charged **only for the unused portion** of the month at the new plan’s rate.\
  Your billing cycle remains the same — it doesn’t restart.
</Info>

---

#### Credit Adjustment

| Plan         | Monthly Credits | Credits Used | Credits Remaining | Credit Adjustment       |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Standard** | 100             | 40           | 60                | —                       |
| **Pro**      | 750             | —            | —                 | \+690 credits instantly |

On upgrade, you immediately receive **the remaining difference** between your current and new plan credits.\
In this example:\
**750 (Pro) − 60 used = 690 new credits** added instantly.

---

<Tip>
  Prorated upgrades ensure a seamless transition — you never lose existing credits, and your available balance updates immediately to match your new plan.
</Tip>

---

### Downgrade Logic

- Takes effect next billing cycle.
- Current credits stay active until cycle end.
- New plan credits begin next renewal.

<Tip>
  Use remaining credits before a downgrade to avoid expiration.
</Tip>

---

## Top-Ups (Credit Refills)

Running low on credits? You can easily purchase additional credits anytime — directly from the subscription modal.

### Current Top-Up Options

| Credits          | Price   | Notes                             |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **5 credits**    | **\$1** | Special introductory offer        |
| **100 credits**  | \$20    | Standard purchase                 |
| **250 credits**  | \$50    | Ideal for small builds            |
| **500 credits**  | \$100   | Most popular choice               |
| **3000 credits** | \$500   | Best value - includes 20% bonus   |
| **6000 credits** | \$1,000 | Enterprise-scale bundle (20% OFF) |

<Info>
  All top-up credits are **one-time purchases** that **never expire**.\
  You can buy as many as you need, anytime.
</Info>

---

### How Top-Up Credits Work

- **Instant Activation:** Credits are added to your balance immediately after purchase.
- **No Expiry:** Top-up credits remain available until used.
- **Usage Priority:** Subscription credits are used first, followed by top-up credits.
- **Flexibility:** Ideal for short-term projects, high-load months, or team bursts.

<Tip>
  Top-up credits don’t reset with your monthly plan - they’re a flexible, permanent backup pool.
</Tip>

---

### When to Top-Up vs. Upgrade

| Scenario                                       | Best Option                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Short-term project or one-time spike           | **Top-Up Credits**                   |
| Hitting credit limits every month              | **Upgrade your plan**                |
| Need more compute or context window            | **Upgrade to Pro**                   |
| Building collaboratively or scaling team usage | **Upgrade to Team**                  |
| Buying 2+ top-ups monthly                      | **Upgrade - better \$/credit ratio** |

<Note>
  **Pro Tip:** Top-ups give flexibility, but upgrading usually provides better long-term value if you’re using large credit volumes.
</Note>

---
