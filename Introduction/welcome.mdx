Learn about Emergent and how to get started.

Emergent is the world's first truly agentic vibe coding platform. Go from prompt to production-ready full-stack apps in an hour — on both web and mobile.

Emergent lets you build full-stack, production-ready applications using **just natural language prompts.**  
From frontend to backend, authentication to deployment, Emergent automates the heavy lifting so you can **focus on building your product.**

Just describe your vision to Emergent — and watch it come alive.

Traditionally, app development requires setting up environments, frameworks, and infrastructure.  
Emergent removes that barrier:

- No boilerplate
- No DevOps hassle
- No config stress

Just describe what you want to build — Emergent generates it.

With built-in GitHub integration, live preview, testing, and deployment, Emergent helps **non-coders, PMs, developers, and solo founders** ship software faster than ever.
